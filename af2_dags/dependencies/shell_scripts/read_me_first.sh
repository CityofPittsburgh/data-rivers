#This directory will contain shell scripts to be executed by bash operators.
#
#You could pass the same contents into a bash command as one long string.
#You could also pass it in with F-strings where the variable was that long string.
#The strings could easily be constructed by a Python function (similar to how SQL queries are made).
#
#While the Python generated string construction would work, this approach allows a complicated script to be created
#and run as a basic execution cmd at the command line. This keeps the code cleaner. It is more complicated to use Python
#to build the cmd first.
